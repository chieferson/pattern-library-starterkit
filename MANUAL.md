## Pattern Library Starterkit Manual

### Set Up your Pattern Library
In order to work with this "Pattern Library Starterkit", you have to set up your frontend resources links to demo live working code.
1. Go to **Kirby Settings** section ((link: panel text: Admin Panel) > Main Menu > Settings)
2. Set your CSS and JS reference links for **Pattern Demo** (The links will be added in pattern demo iFrame HEAD section and at the end of BODY)
3. Activate the "Comments" feature if you like. This will add a user comment feature to every pattern page.
3. Change the content of **Home** as you wish...
3. Now you are set and **ready** to create your first pattern

### Creating your first pattern
There are two procedures how I recoomend to add Patterns

#### 1. Early Design Phase (no implementation done, yet)
I recommend to start as early as possible setting up and maintaining your patterns for your project. The most important two topics you should take care of are the **structure** of your pattern library and the **naming** of your patterns.

1. Add an "Overview Page(s)" to create a structure page like "form elements"
2. Add a "Pattern Page" to create a pattern within the overview page.
3. Name your pattern
4. Add a description, author, etc.
5. Drag & Drop e.g. a pattern screenshot (PNG, JPG, etc.) to the "Developer sample code" area
7. DONE... you can preview the pattern right away
8. Set your pattern page "visible"

#### 2. Production Phase (frontend implementation done)
As you implement your project you can add and maintain your patterns to your pattern library.

If you already created the pattern in early design phase, you can build on top of your work and go to step 5.

1. Add an "Overview Page(s)" to create a structure page like "form elements"
2. Add a "Pattern Page" to create a pattern within the overview page.
3. Name your pattern
4. Add a description, author, etc.
5. Add your pattern HTML markup to "Pattern Demo" section
6. Add your commented developer sample code to "Developer sample code". make sure you escape the code with three inverted commas ('''CODEBLOCK''')
7. DONE... you can preview the pattern right away
8. Set your pattern page "visible"

If you like, you can also create & maintain patterns by manually adding folders and pattern.txt files to your /content folder. Consult (link: http://getkirby.com/docs text: Kirby CMS doc) for further details.

#### Keep on adding patterns...
