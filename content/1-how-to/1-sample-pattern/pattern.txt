This is a Sample Pattern to illustrate the **Pattern Library Starter Kit** functionality. In this section the pattern details and usage is described. I recommend to get in detail why and how this pattern is used and which problem does it solve (e.g. a classic best practice). Get in detail about do's and don'ts how you use the pattern and which variations may exist.

You can use ``<p>Code Formatting</p>`` to get in detail or link to (link:how-to text: other Pages) and Patterns. For details on your Pattern Code use the sample code section.
